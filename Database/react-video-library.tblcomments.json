Then I moved to others like Java and c sharp and plus plus to name a few. I even learned Fortran because of a job needed it(very useful but not at the same time, lol). I've turned a page from working with a company and decided to design games a long time dream of mine. I hope wholeheartedly that this video helps all of you the same way it did for me.
